            <p class="said_tribute">I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.</p>

            <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
            <p class="said_tribute">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Appple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.</p>
